<P>The procedure of this project is relatively complete. It will detect at the very beginning, find out the missing or insufficient places and make modifications, and then carry out the detection to check whether it reaches the standard, and then upload the report to get the final feedback to complete the purpose<P>

<P>Here is a system diagram that depicts the equipment and tools required, with detailed diagrams that make it easy to understand<P>
<h4>As a result of the current outbreak, many factories or shops have been closed or closed, leaving employees unable to go to work. Then factories need mechanical automation to achieve industry, which can not only avoid the phenomenon of intensive staff, but also can not rest for production, saving more time and money.
This IT project is relatively easy to complete, as long as the server of the system is replaced, the parts are reassembled, and the automatic data is detected to reach the standard data<h4>
